#Handwritten Maths Solver
Our project is to predict the alphabets and the result of mathematical equations with
maximum accuracy which is provided by user in the form of images to the model.
The webapp gives user the choice to select between alphabets and equations and
accordingly user is required to provide the image. This serves as input to the
model.
The prediction is displayed on the screen.
This becomes an interesting problem to solve as handwriting differ from person to
person, in terms of style and size, its difficult to get it recognized by computers so our
model serves the purpose by recognising characters with accuracy of around 97- 99%.

We have successfully developed Handwritten character recognition (alphabets and
solving mathematical equations) with Python, Tensor flow, keras and Machine
Learning libraries.
Handwritten characters have been recognized with more than 97% test accuracy.
This can be also further extended to identifying the handwritten characters of other
languages too.
Predicting results of the handwritten equations have achieved accuracy of up to 99
%. This can be further extended to solve complex equations.
